# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a simple personal finances tracker which calculates your available monthly budget, based on a list of incomes and expenses.

In this project I learned and used the following concepts:
 - React Hooks;
 - React Context;
 - Connecting the app to a database (google firestore);
 - Styling with SASS;
 
 Still working on this to improve the UI, and to add new features.
